    mc "Wait — you mean this isn’t just a game?"
    nova "Not anymore. You’ve crossed into a world scarred by endless wars — each one destroying pieces of ancient knowledge and lost technology."
    mc "That sounds... serious. Like post-apocalyptic serious."
    nova "Very much so. No one even knows what year it is anymore. Wars reset the calendar, shaped by the chaos and shifting religions that follow."
    mc "So there's no real history? Just... fragments?"
    nova "Exactly. And it’s in that chaos where your purpose lies."
    nova "Your mission is simple in words, but not in action: restore peace and equality to this broken world."
    mc "Peace and equality? That’s... a pretty big ask for one person."
    nova "You won’t be alone. You’ll have help — from powerful allies known as the 'Protectors'. The Alliance has chosen to trust you."
    mc "The Alliance? Is that like... a government or something?"
    nova "A resistance. One of the last coalitions fighting for balance, not power."
    nova "Any questions so far?"
    mc "*pauses* Honestly? A thousand. But mostly... why me?"
    nova "That answer will come with time, [mc.name]. For now, know that you’ve been chosen for a reason."
    mc "Right. No pressure or anything."
    nova "I understand it’s overwhelming."
    mc "It is. But... I don’t want to walk away, either. If I can help, I want to try."
    nova "Good. You’ll need that spirit where you’re going."
    nova "Let’s begin by finding your first ally. The Alliance is offering you three Protector candidates."
    nova "Each brings something unique to your team."
    mc "Alright. Let’s see who they are."
