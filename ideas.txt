- I will be able to have at max 3 protectors working at the same team -> for missions and so on -> the others will stay at my house protecting me

- each of them have 10 levels -> at level 5 and level 10 we can choose from 2 different things
    - each protector would have a different habilities ex:
        - for ninja at level 5 -> we can make it finding a very recent technology and it would make him very powerfull others
        - we can make him finding a duet -> and he would have always an assistent (ranged ninja)
